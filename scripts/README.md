Note that due to the need to use a remote desktop to access R for part of the combined research, use of simple file paths from the working directory was often difficult and instead full path names are used. This would need adaptation to function.

If not running the rmd, but want to run the scripts step by step, the script  model_making.R can be run. This has links into other scripts that will launch them all in the correct order (the .rmd begins by running this script).
