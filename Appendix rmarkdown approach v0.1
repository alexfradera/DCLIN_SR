Sensitivity Analyses



## What this is
This is the full R code and outputs for the Data Report for Audit of a New Telephone Triage System in a Psychological Therapies Team: Impact on Service Access, Efficiency, and Staff Absence and Stress'"

All data analysis was completed using R in the program RStudio, and this appendix was generated as a Rmarkdown document, which makes it easy to combine formatted text like this with the code used to conduct the analysis and the output from that analysis.

Code is formatted to look like this:

```{r example, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
print("Hello")
2+2
```

Output of computations will appear in the text like this:
```{r two_plus, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
print("Hello")
2+2
```

I can also just use the code to compute `r 2+2`

## Start of code
Need to figure out whether I am going to bring the scripts in using *source* or run them, save an RData file and then use *load* (in a similar way) instead...



```{r test_script}
source("./scripts/SBEP_patient_script.R")
```

Note: Other options for code helpers

Modular .R scripts: For bigger projects, I often break my R scripts down into smaller scripts, e.g.,

    1_tidy.R, 2_models.R, 3_plots.R

In my workflows, each of these sources the last. I.e., the first line of 2_models.R is

source("1_tidy.R")

And in my R Markdown file, I source the highest level or a final .RData file.

## In text stuff
The average number of days people waited was `r  round(mean(ap_patients$RTT_duration), digits=0)` but note that isn't grouped yet.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
